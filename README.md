# EDUSTIPEND PRE-REACT TEST

This is my submission for the EduStipend Frontend(React) test.

## IDENTIFYING THE CORE COMPONENTS

The core components are the Navbar and the Sidebar.

In the code, they are rendered on a page called Landing.

They are made up of other minor components which are made to populate the code.

## INSTALLATION

This code was created using Vite + React. so, to run this code, you would need to;

Clone the code first.

To do this, you have to run your command prompt or terminal by clicking on the windows button and searching for command prompt or terminal.

When found, you open it and route to your desktop by typing

```
cd desktop
```

Then you hit enter or return. This should lead you to your desktop.

Then you clone by typing

```
git clone https://github.com/Franklivania/edustipend-prework-assignment
```

After it is cloned, you can route to the folder by typing

```
cd edustipend-prework-assignment
```

Then you run,

```
npm install
```

This should install all the necessary dependencies.

After this, you then run;

```
npm run dev
```

This would then start the code on a localhost. 

Click `Ctrl + Click` on the link to open on your default browser.

If you want to open the code in your VS code editor, you can run 

```
code .
```

this should be run before you run `npm install`.

## CONCLUSION

This code tries its best to conform to responsivness on various devices, and it tries to use minimal code to do that.

Thank you for coming!
